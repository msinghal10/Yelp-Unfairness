"My 74 year old mother was moving from one apartment to a better on about 6 miles away. We had a U-Haul reserved and had set up for two helpers to load and unload. The day of the move the guys got there and started moving stuff but started complaining after about half an hour. They used up the time by moving slow and taking their time coming back in for more. We ended up unloading the truck without them (with the help of a neighbor). The next day Reese an one other guy brought a U-Haul truck and loaded the rest of her stuff and took it to her new apartment. Reese kept telling her ""he wanted to make it right"". In my eyes he did and then some.

"We had guests coming for three days and the clothes dryer started to sound like a car with no muffler.  We had no experience with local appliance repair companies, so I called 4 of them cold.  the two that answered did not give me confidence.  I left messages for the other 2.  Jesse from Absolute Best Appliance called back within 15 minutes.  He sounded professional, reasonable and knowledgeable.  He agreed to come within a one hour window the next morning, just as I asked.  He directed me to the location of the model number on the dryer so that he could be sure to have the right parts with him.  I have him the model number.  The next morning he called 15 minutes before the appointment to tell me that he was on the way.  when he arrived, he was professional and courteous.  He fixed the dryer, but then did not like the sound it made, so he stayed longer and performed additional service.  All of his work, including the parts cost a total of less than one hundred dollars.  I happily paid him, and gave him a well deserved tip.  He was surprised and very grateful.  It turned out that Absolute Best Appliance is appropriately named.

I was taking my daughter to another salon and always a problem with getting an appointment. Also her previous hairstylist never got there until 11 am....my whole day was always ruined due to the stylist talked alot and stopped alot so it took extra long to for my baby to get her completed. I decided to take her to a Dominican salon because I heard they were great with doing natural hair....I do not know the stylist name...but she was great.

"Their regular ""Sermon"" espresso blend makes for delicious, mild-tasting lattes and caps. They also have different roasts from time to time, always superb. Milk steamed perfectly every time. Polite, friendly staff who take their coffee seriously.

"rarely write reviews (or get frustrated with service workers), but this place was horrendous and unsafe. Absolute trash service. I ordered an egg and cheese croissant and they gave me a crappy english muffin instead -- and I specifically said, ""extra thick"" for my frozen drink and it was completely liquified. When I asked for it to be remade, they fought me on it and blamed it on the machine while simultaneously saying that it was perfectly frozen. Can't be both. Your machine is user-operated. So if you grind the ice for too long, it's obviously going to turn the ice to liquid.  That's how blenders work. The simple solution to that would be.... grind the ice for less time??? That's not the machine's fault. Learn how to make a frozen drink and don't argue with your customers when they pay for a $6 frozen drink and you hand them a completely liquified mess (twice). And I was the only customer in the store so it's not like they were swamped.THEN they pretended to remake it, but obviously didn't because they didn't even turn the machine back on and handed me the same disaster. Additionally, one worker pulled down her mask while I was standing right there, and the person putting the drink together wasn't even wearing gloves. I get that working customer service sucks right now, and I was perfectly reasonable and willing to wait for it to be remade, but they were too busy arguing with me to bother. I would say to avoid this terrible location in general, but especially during a global pandemic where they are violating state mandates with unsafe behavior.",0.0,2.0,9/3/2020,Alex R.,"San Francisco, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,rzQAxgKnHs6K_z-jKnBPWg,1.0
"For the Franklin area this is one of the nicer apartment complexes. HOWEVER please make sure you have any verbal agreement documented and signed. Two examples in my case: 1. We were told it was okay for us to move in early even though we had a month left on a pre-existing lease because they would NOT charge us for the first month, WRONG! We still got charged and when we confronted the girl who told us this and her manager nothing was done and it turned into he said/she said. This cost us an additional $1300. 2. When moving out and breaking a lease early we paid the fees associated (no problem there), but my fiance negotiated that she would turn over the keys a month early to Dwell and they would give us a break on that month's rent. This is a win-win because they still get a large portion of that months rent and fees and are still able to rent it out to someone else (they are getting double rent that month). But, being the snakes they are they reneged and acted like they had no idea what we were talking about when we confronted them.

"My advice is to Eat somewhere else!!!!  Farm to table  NO WAY!!!  - HORRIBLE food and service was questionable at best.  Would have given zero stars if possible. We were going to go to the Mexican restaurant and thought we would give this one a try instead BIG MISTAKE!!First it took forever to get the drinks - then she came with the weakest tea I have ever had and it looked and tasted more like water.  We placed our order and waited over 40 minutes to get it.  During our wait we were ""entertained"" by a guy who was too loud for the small room and While he was ok when singing songs in his key - others ike the Elton John song he attempted was painful.   We ordered Fried pickles - I think these were WalMart pickles fried in old grease and served with Ranch dressing - nothing homemade about any of it.  They were limp and not much flavor at all. Another 25 min later we finally got our food - I ordered the BLT which for 9.99 I was expecting homemade bread fresh tomatoes and fresh lettuce.  NOPE  I think it may have been thin sliced bunny bread, microwaved bacon burnt beyond recognition and the limp lettuce with 2 slices of very small tomatoes.  I get more on a Burger King hamburger than I did here.  Again - farm to table  no way!!  I was stupid and paid the $1 upcharge for onion rings - They were HORRIBLE - there was nothing left but the skin of the onion and again burnt beyond recognition - again Burger King has better onion rings and they are horrible.  My son ordered the chicken breast and french fries - he said the chicken was burnt with very little flavor and it was not as good as the ones I make in the microwave.  The fries were not fresh at all either -  I think frozen.  So NOTHING I can say good about our experience - sorry EATS was really hoping for a good Farm to Table meal and was sorely disappoointed.",0.0,1.0,9/8/2018,Amy W.,"San Francisco, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,bs9HgDfOKlVv4tO7777XLg,1.0
"I took my 10 year old car to have the paint freshened up, I spoke w/ Scott (the manager) He told me I should add integrated clear coat to make the paint last longer in the Florida heat.

"To know Lindsay is to love Lindsay. She is truly a special person with a special gift.  I came across Lindsay on her radio show on Sedona radio, Somehow I stumble across her  show because she was interviewing one of my favorite authors. I was lucky enough to get through and talk to my favorite author.  I am a true believer that things happen in our life for a reason.  The events leading up to meeting Lindsay are evident  to this statement.  I happened to be on vacation in a State where Lindsay lives. When I found out she lived in the State where I was vacationing, I immediately emailed her and we set up an appointment so I could meet her and  have a reading.  Much to my amazement Lindsay  was receiving messages from my love while she was driving to meet me.  My mouth dropped  once she started telling me the messages she received from my love ones.  Now, I don't know Lindsay and she doesnt know me, but by the time I was done she knew more things about my life than most people who know me. I was amazed and  so impressed that when I came home I told some friends and they booked a reading as well. They too where in awe. They just couldn't believe what they where hearing. I was so happy for all of them. Plus I was so proud of Lindsay who's special gift shined for them as it did for me. You can tell Lindsay in a caring soul and  loves to bring messages to you from your love ones.  I wold highly recommended you receive a reading from Lindsay. I  know you will not be disappointed. You will leave Lindsay with such love in your soul and know that our love ones are with you all the time.  I am so grateful that I stumbled across Lindsay's radio show.

"I cannot tell you enough how good my experience was at Shane Co. Everyone there is amazing. Amazing isn't even a word that can describe the time, patience, care, and knowledge that everyone has there. But, honestly, there is no one better to work with than Ben Wilkes. I have gone to him for many things, but recently worked with him in order to buy an engagement ring. Ben not only is great at what he does, but he's just a good guy on top of it. He took the time to explain all the typical things involved with buying an engagement ring, but really went the extra mile to make sure I understood everything and ended up with a ring that my fiancée absolutely loved! As we were going through the process, he made sure to send me pictures of diamonds he had searched for and was understanding as I came in to see what they looked like in different settings. He was able to get me the best value and best looking ring in the price range I was looking at. It was his help that allowed me to get a ring that my fiancée can't stop staring at!

"I would NOT recommend Abington Reproductive to ANYONE. Specifically, the Langhorne office is a complete joke. Following reasons why:1) You will never see a doctor there. Always a nurse who does your ultrasounds, monitoring etc. Even the IUI procedure is done by nurse and not doctor. Doctors are there for ""consultation"" therefore, if you have specific questions during your cycle, you have to set up a separate appt for a ""talk"".........i.e. meaning more cash in their pockets, and more co-pays for you.2) Dr. Nichols might be the rudest doctor I have ever met. As mentioned, since the doctors here rarely do anything, and the nurse couldn't answer my questions during a particular cycle, I requested a doctor call me back. She started out nice, but after 2 minutes of taking up her precious time, she actually had the nerve to snap at me and say, ""she is really busy, and these types of questions should be asked in person, and that I need to set up a seperate ""talk"" appt with her. 3) Billing is a complete joke, as many mentioned above already. 4) There hours are completely inflexible. God forbid you have to do your IUI on a Sunday, as you are out of luck, since they only do IVFs. They also do not take many afternoon IUI appts, so more often than not, you are getting your IUI 24 hours or less after trigger, vs. other doctors generally do it at 36 hours.5) I don't expect the doctor to me my BFF obviously, but when going to a specialist and shelling out the kind of money you will have to for constant monitoring, I expect the doctor to more cordial, in less of a rush, and patient to answer all my questions in a polite manner and not spout generic statistics at me.6) You will not get personalized protocol here for your infertility. They do everything by the book and very generic. As you will find out, all women are different, and instead of creating a protocol or solution to meet your individual needs, or offering you alternatives if the first few protocols failed, they just want you to continue as usual, citing the generic statistic as, ""You only have 25% chance every month anyway, which is why it didn't work, no need to change protocol""PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT WASTE your precious time and money going to them. Find another specialist. I did, after 6 months and boy was it amazing to learn the above is not the ""norm"" with reproductive specialists.",0.0,2.0,1/7/2015,Jane S.,"Philadelphia, PA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,-IXwTFtq58ZkkEjVz4CRtQ,2.0
